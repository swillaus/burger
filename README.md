Hw wk14: burger

Welcome to the buger game. 

The burger game has been created by Sam Will and it is designed to test creating an ORM application. You can see within the app there is function to READ all, CREATE new records and UPDATE existing.

The aim of the application is to add any burgers you want to eat using the input form. This will produce a list of burgers you are looking to eat. The 'Devour' button then allows you to make this as 'devoured' (ie eaten) so that you can keep track of everything you have eated.

Performance
Overall the application works well. I had some challenges with my update route so am looking to update this. I also changed the styling from the guide applcation as I thought this structure allowed me to keep the app on one screen
